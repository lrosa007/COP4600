## Course Goal and Topics

To introduce you to the principles and concepts of computer operating systems.

* Definition, purpose and history of operating systems
* Processor Scheduling
* Memory Management
* Device Management
* I/0 Management
* Special OS Topics

## Course Layout

We will broadly follow the text, amplifying the material in the topics above and further topics as time permits. Discussions of operating systems in the real world, and their implications, will be interjected liberally.

## Assignments

Assignments will include a combination of written reports, question-and-answer responses, and programming. *Written reports will be graded for mechanics.*

## Ethics

As reflected in the UCF creed, integrity and scholarship are core values that should guide our conduct and decisions as members of the UCF community. Plagiarism and cheating contradict these values, and so are very serious academic offenses. Penalties can include a failing grade in an assignment or in the course, or suspension or expulsion from the university. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with and follow the Universityâ€™s Rules of Conduct (see http://www.osc.sdes.ucf.edu/).

## Exceptions

In general I will neither accept late work nor offer make-up tests. I may make exceptions with valid reason before the due date or test date. I will make exceptions on or after the due date or test date only in well- documented extreme circumstances.

## Attendance

Class attendance is not mandatory and I will not take roll. However, this is a lecture course and you are responsible, without exception, for all information from all class sessions, including revisions to this syllabus.

## Grading

Standard scale (A = 90-100) and weights are as follows:
* Assignments (25%)
* Midterm Exam 1 (25%)
* Midterm Exam 2 (25%)
* Final Exam (25%)

*The above criteria represent the lowest grade you will receive in the course. Several other factors may raise your grade, including but not limited to overall class performance and improvement in your performance over the semester.*
