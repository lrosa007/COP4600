1. Choose an operating system that:
  * Was introduced prior to 1990
  * Is, or was, either a time-sharing or fully multitasking operating system
  * Is not any version of MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, any Unix-like system, or the Macintosh OS
2. Describe, in one page (and that’s 12 point, a standard font, and 1” margins):
  * The history of its development
  * Its intended usage domain, and the general characteristics of operating and/or using it
  * One distinctive feature or trait that set it apart from other operating systems either historically or at the time
  * Whether it or any of its descendants remain in use, and why

*You need two references, one of which may be an online reference to the operating system and the other of which should be a manual, textbook, or contemporary article describing it.*
