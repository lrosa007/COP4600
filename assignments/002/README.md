# Assignment 2

**Learning Objective**: To gain a fuller understanding of process scheduling algorithms by implementing them.

**Development**: Use C, C++, C# or Java.  Create a console-mode application that does not use a windowing environment.  Document your code adequately, including your name and the course name at the top of every file.

**Assignment**: Implement the First-Come First-Served, preemptive Shortest Job First, and Round-Robin algorithms as for single processors.

**Input**: Your program will read a file from the current directory called **processes.in**, which will be formatted as follows.  Your program should ignore everything on a line after a **#** mark and ignore additional spaces in input.

```
processcount 2     # Read 2 processes
runfor 15          # Run for 15 time units
use rr             # Can be fcfs, sjf, or rr
quantum 2          # Time quantum â€“ only if using rr
process name P1 arrival 3 burst 5
process name P2 arrival 0 burst 9
end
```

*Note that the processes do not need to be specified in order of arrival, and do not need to have similar names.*

**Output**: Generate a file called **processes.out**, formatted as follows.

```
2 processes
Using Round-Robin
Quantum 2

Time 0: P2 arrived
Time 0: P2 selected (burst 9)
Time 2: P2 selected (burst 7)
Time 3: P1 arrived
Time 4: P1 selected (burst 5)
Time 6: P2 selected (burst 5)
Time 8: P1 selected (burst 3)
Time 10: P2 selected (burst 3)
Time 12: P1 selected (burst 1)
Time 13: P1 finished
Time 13: P2 selected (burst 1)
Time 14: P2 finished
Time 14: Idle
Finished at time 15

P1 wait 5 turnaround 10
P2 wait 5 turnaround 14
```

**Clarifications**

This version of Round-Robin should not run the scheduler immediately upon the arrival of a new process, unless the CPU is currently idle.

Your program will not be given an input that results in an ambiguous decision, such as identical arrival times for Round-Robin or identical burst lengths for SJF; you should avoid generating an error in that case on general principles but it will not appear in either the example inputs or the grading inputs.
